# polaris-starter

The goal of this project is to be a quick way to get started with _Polaris_, the next edition of Ember.

Leading up to an _Edition_, the pit of incoherence can be quite deep, as there are lots of moving parts leading up to the solidification of what is in an Edition.

This project is your one-stop-shop for features and patterns expected to be a part of of _Polaris_.

The demo app contained in this repo is deployed here: https://polaris-starter.pages.dev/

Below, you'll find the default README content for new ember projects.
